# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning to classify Iris flowers into different species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using the famous Iris dataset.

## Dataset
- The Iris dataset contains features like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
- Labels represent different species of the flower.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Data Exploration & Visualization
2. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
3. Model Selection (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)
4. Model Evaluation and Accuracy Check

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries using:
